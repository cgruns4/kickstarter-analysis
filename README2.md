# Analysis of Launch Date and Funding Goals on Kickstarter Campaigns
---
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter launch date and funding goals to determine impact on theater funding.
---
### The following is a summary of findings from the Launch Date data:

* The most successful time to launch a theater funding campaign is during May and June.  These
  two months have the highest number of successful outcomes, and the highest success rate.

* The least favorable month to initiate a campaign would be December, as this month has the lowest
  number of successful campaigns, and a nearly equal amount of failures.
