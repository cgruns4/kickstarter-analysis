# Analysis of Launch Date and Funding Goals on Kickstarter Campaigns
---
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter to determine launch date impact on overall theater underwriting, and the influence of funding goals on Play funding.

### Summary of findings from the Launch Date data on Theater funding:

* The most successful time to launch a theater funding campaign is during May and June.  These
  two months have the highest number of successful outcomes, and the highest success rate.

* The least favorable month to initiate a campaign would be December, as this month has the lowest
  number of successful campaigns, and a nearly equal amount of failures.

### Summary of findings from the Funding Goals data on Play funding:

* The highest success rate for Play funding is achieved with a target funding goal of less than $5,000.  There is an ample size of data to back up the 
  reliability of this assessment.  $35k-$50k also acheives a high success rate, but contains asignificantly smaller sample size.  It would be my 
  recommendation to launch a funding campaing with a goal of $5,000 or less.

There are some potential limitations to this analysis.
