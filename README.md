# Analysis of Launch Date and Funding Goals on Kickstarter Campaigns
---
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter to determine launch date impact on overall theater underwriting, and the influence of funding goals on Play funding.

### Summary of findings from the Launch Date data on Theater funding:

* The most successful time to launch a theater funding campaign is during May and June.  These
  two months have the highest number of successful outcomes, and the highest success rate.  As such, I would
  advise to launch a theater funding campaign during one of these two months.  

* The least favorable month to initiate a campaign would be December.  This month has the lowest number
  of successful campaigns, and a near equal number of failures.  I would advise avoiding a campaign launch
  during December.

### Summary of findings from the Funding Goals data on Play funding:

* The highest success rate for Play funding is achieved with a target funding goal of less than $5,000.  There is an ample size of data to back up the 
  reliability of this assessment.  $35k-$50k also achieves a high success rate but contains a significantly smaller sample size.  It would be my 
  recommendation to launch a funding campaign with a goal of $5,000 or less.

### There are some potential limitations to this analysis.  

* These specific dataset references are not broken down by location, which could skew results if client interested in specific country.
* This data only includes two subset conditions of a larger data set being modeled. 

### Recommendation for Additional Analysis:
* Fully analyze complete dataset to provide more thorough analysis
* Recommend adding pivot table and pivot chart in order to examine overall data in more detail
